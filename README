Notable changes:

0.8.1 24-December-2012: We had been compiling a reference BLAS with
64-bit integer indexing without decorating the function names with
underscores, in an attempt to differentiate such BLAS functions from 
the standard R blas functions (which usually have underscores).

But, it turns out that this is not good enough. Many high-performance
BLAS libraries like MKL and even ATLAS can include function names both
with and without underscores.

So, we've manually adjusted reference blas function names to avoid
name conflicts with default BLAS functions. Our internal 64-bit reference
BLAS names now all begin with INT8_.

The package uses the default R BLAS by default. If you really want to
use the 64-bit indexed BLAS, install the package with:

REFBLAS=1 R CMD INSTALL bigalgebra_0.8.1.tar.gz



0.7.1 18-November-2011: Vastly simplified core linear algebra dependencies,
focusing on provided reference BLAS and LAPACK routines. We removed all
configure files and fancy configuration options for 3rd party libraries,
as they are very difficult to uniformly support across platforms. Advanced
users desiring 3rd party BLAS and LAPACK support can modify the package
Makevars files, or include custom configure files as required.
