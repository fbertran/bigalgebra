`bigalgebra` provides fast linear algebra primitives that operate seamlessly on
base `matrix` objects and [`bigmemory::big.matrix`] containers. The package
wraps BLAS and LAPACK routines with R-friendly helpers so that vector updates,
matrix products, and classic decompositions work the same way in memory or on
disk.

## Package highlights

* **big.matrix workflows** – Guidance on creating, sharing, and cleaning up
  file-backed matrices is collected in the
  [Working with big.matrix Objects vignette](https://fbertran.github.io/bigalgebra/articles/big-matrix-workflows.html).
* **Vector kernels** – Level 1 BLAS-style helpers such as `dset()`, `dsub()` and
  `ddot()` extend familiar vector algebra to `big.matrix` inputs. See the
  [Level 1 BLAS-Style Helpers vignette](https://fbertran.github.io/bigalgebra/articles/level-1-blas-style-helpers.html).
* **Matrix products** – Wrappers including `dgemm()` and `dsymm()` expose Level 3
  BLAS routines for dense matrix multiplication with optional file-backed
  outputs. Explore the
  [Matrix Wrapper Helpers vignette](https://fbertran.github.io/bigalgebra/articles/matrix-wrapper-helpers.html).
* **LAPACK decompositions** – QR, Cholesky, eigenvalue, and SVD helpers (`dgeqrf()`,
  `dpotrf()`, `dgeev()`, `dgesdd()`) bring advanced factorisations to large
  datasets. Walk through the
  [LAPACK Decompositions vignette](https://fbertran.github.io/bigalgebra/articles/lapack-decompositions.html).

## Package options

The package defines a number of global options that begin with `bigalgebra`:

Option  Default value
* `bigalgebra.temp_pattern` with default `matrix_`
* `bigalgebra.tempdir` with default `tempdir`
* `bigalgebra.mixed_arithmetic_returns_R_matrix` with default `TRUE`
* `bigalgebra.DEBUG` with default `FALSE`

The `bigalgebra.tempdir` option must be a function that returns a temporary
directory path used to store big matrix results of BLAS and LAPACK operations.
The default value is simply the base R `tempdir()` function.

The `bigalgebra.temp_pattern` option is a name prefix for file names of generated
big matrix objects output as a result of BLAS and LAPACK operations.

The `bigalgebra.mixed_arithmetic_returns_R_matrix` option determines whether
arithmetic operations involving an R matrix or vector and a `big.matrix`
matrix or vector return a big matrix (when the option is `FALSE`), or return a
normal R matrix (`TRUE`).

## BLAS and LAPACK backends

The package is built, by default, with R's native BLAS libraries, which use
32-bit signed integer indexing. The default build is limited to vectors of at
most 2^31 − 1 entries and matrices with at most 2^31 − 1 rows and 2^31 − 1
columns (note that standard R matrices are limited to 2^31 − 1 total entries).

The package includes a reference BLAS implementation that supports 64-bit
integer indexing, relaxing the limitation on vector lengths and matrix row and
column limits. Installation of this package with the 64-bit reference BLAS
implementation may be performed from the command-line install:

`REFBLAS=1 R CMD INSTALL bigalgebra`

where `bigalgebra` is the source package (for example, `bigalgebra_0.9.0.tar.gz`).

The package may also be built with user-supplied external BLAS and LAPACK
libraries, in either 32- or 64-bit varieties. This is an advanced topic that
requires additional `Makevars` modification, and may include adjustment of the
low-level calling syntax depending on the library used.

Feel free to contact us for help installing and running the package.

This website, the unit tests, some C code fixes and improvements as well as
these examples were created by F. Bertrand.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bigalgebra from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bigalgebra")
```

You can install the development version of bigalgebra from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("fbertran/bigalgebra")
```

## Quick tour of the functionality

The snippets below mirror the worked examples in the vignettes and show how the
helpers behave with in-memory and file-backed matrices.

### Level 1 BLAS helpers

These helpers cover vector updates, reductions, and element-wise transforms
such as the in-place square root provided by `dsqrt()`.
```{r level1-example}
library(bigmemory)
library(bigalgebra)

x <- bigmemory::big.matrix(5, 1, init = 0)
dset(ALPHA = 9, X = x)
dsqrt(X = x)
x[]

y <- bigmemory::big.matrix(5, 1, init = 1)
dvcal(ALPHA = 0.5, X = x, BETA = 2, Y = y)
y[]
```

### Matrix products with `dgemm()`

```{r dgemm-example}
A <- bigmemory::big.matrix(5, 4, init = 1)
B <- bigmemory::big.matrix(4, 4, init = 2)
C <- bigmemory::big.matrix(5, 4, init = 0)

dgemm(A = A, B = B, C = C, ALPHA = 1, BETA = 0)
C[]
```

### LAPACK decompositions

```{r lapack-example}
set.seed(1)
M <- matrix(rnorm(9), 3)
SPD <- crossprod(M)
SPD_big <- as.big.matrix(SPD)
dpotrf(A = SPD_big)
chol_factor <- SPD_big[,]
chol_factor[lower.tri(chol_factor)] <- 0
chol_factor
```

### File-backed `big.matrix` workflows

```{r filebacked-example}
tmpdir <- tempdir()
file_big <- filebacked.big.matrix(3, 3, init = diag(3),
                                  backingpath = tmpdir,
                                  backingfile = "example.bin")
file_big[1, 3] <- 5
file_big[]
rm(file_big)
gc()
```

## Available vignettes

The full vignette set expands on the topics above and demonstrates how the
routines interact:

1. **Working with big.matrix Objects** – Managing shared memory, file backing,
   and clean-up for large datasets.
2. **Level 1 BLAS-Style Helpers** – Filling vectors, Hadamard products, and
   reductions on disk-backed data.
3. **Matrix Wrapper Helpers** – Symmetric and general matrix products, including
   strategies for chaining operations.
4. **LAPACK Decompositions with bigalgebra** – QR, Cholesky, eigenvalue, and SVD
   workflows for both in-memory and file-backed matrices.
