This package provides arithmetic functions for native `R` matrices and
`bigmemory::big.matrix` objects. 

The package defines a number of global options that begin with `bigalgebra`.

They include:

Option  Default value
* `bigalgebra.temp_pattern` with default `matrix_`
* `bigalgebra.tempdir` with default `tempdir`
* `bigalgebra.mixed_arithmetic_returns_R_matrix` with default `TRUE`
* `bigalgebra.DEBUG` with default `FALSE`

The `bigalgebra.tempdir` option must be a function that returns
a temporary directory path used to big matrix results of BLAS and
LAPACK operations. The deault value is simply the default R `tempdir`
function.

The `bigalgebra.temp_pattern` is a name prefix for file names of generated
big matrix objects output as a result of BLAS and LAPACK operations.

The `bigalgebra.mixed_arithmetic_returns_R_matrix` option determines
whether arithmetic operations involving an R matrix or vector and a big.matrix
matrix or vector return a big matrix (when the option is `FALSE`), or
return a normal R matrix (`TRUE`).

The package is built, by default, with `R`'s native BLAS libraries, which use
32-bit signed integer indexing. The default build is limited to vectors of at
most 2^31 - 1 entries and matrices with at most 2^31 - 1 rows and 2^31 - 1
columns (note that standard R matrices are limtied to 2^31 - 1 total entries).

The package includes a reference BLAS implementation that supports 64-bit
integer indexing, relaxing the limitation on vector lengths and matrix
row and column limits. Installation of this package with the 64-bit reference
BLAS implementation may be performed from the command-line install:

`REFBLAS=1 R CMD INSTALL bigalgebra`

where `bigalgebra` is the source package (for example, `bigalgebra_0.9.0.tar.gz`).

The package may also be build with user-supplied external BLAS and LAPACK
libraries, in either 32- or 64-bit varieties. This is an advanced topic
that requires additional Makevars modification, and may include adjustment
of the low-level calling syntax depending on the library used.

Feel free to contact us for help installing and running the package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bigalgebra from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bigalgebra")
```

You can install the development version of bigalgebra from [github](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("fbertran/bigalgebra")
```


## Examples

```{r datasetsimulation1}
library("bigmemory")
A <- bigmemory::big.matrix(5,4,init = 1)
B <- bigmemory::big.matrix(4,4,init = 2)

C <- A %*% B       # Returns a new big.matrix object
D <- A[] %*% B[]   # Compute the same thing in R

print(C - D)       # Compare the results (subtraction of an R matrix from a
                   # big.matrix)

# The next example illustrates mixing R and big.matrix objects. It returns by
# default (see # options("bigalgebra.mixed_arithmetic_returns_R_matrix")
D <- matrix(rnorm(16),4)
E <- A %*% D
```
